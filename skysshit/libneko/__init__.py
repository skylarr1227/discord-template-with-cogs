Various helpers and utilities that I have created whilst working on
Nekozilla1, Nekozilla2, Nekozilla3, Neko, kat, leon, and a few other
bot projects.

This includes various fixes to stuff in Discord.py; a paginator and navigator
to allow displaying content more than one message wide cleanly and efficiently;
many language addons such as singleton classes, async constructor classes,
collections; and a few general purpose cogs and commands such as an exec/eval
command.
